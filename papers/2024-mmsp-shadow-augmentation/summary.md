# Shadow Augmentation for Handwashing Action Recognition: From Synthetic to Real Datasets (MMSP 2024)

Studies how shadow-induced domain shift degrades handwashing action recognition and proposes shadow augmentation to harden models.

- Media/architecture: video (synthetic + real); evaluates standard action models with added shadow augmentation pipeline.
- Contribution: shows that controlled shadow simulation improves robustness when transferred to real footage.
- Availability: datasets referenced (including shadow sets) are non-public; code and weights not provided; no external API.
