# Shadow Augmentation for Handwashing Action Recognition: From Synthetic to Real Datasets (MMSP 2024)

Studies how shadow-induced domain shift degrades handwashing action recognition and proposes shadow augmentation to harden models. Systematically varies synthetic shadow attributes, then transfers augmentation to real data to improve robustness across architectures and datasets.
