# Hand-Hygiene Activity Recognition in Egocentric Video (MMSP 2019)

Two-stage pipeline for detecting hand-hygiene actions in egocentric videos from food-manufacturing environments.

- Media/architecture: egocentric video; temporal localization with motion/hand masks, then a two-stream CNN (RGB + motion cues) for classification.
- Contribution: reaches ~80% detection accuracy on a 100-participant dataset with a search-based two-stage design.
- Availability: dataset not public; code and trained weights not provided; no external API.
