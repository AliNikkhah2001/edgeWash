## Vision-Based Hand Hygiene Monitoring with Depth Cameras (Stanford PAIR 2015)

Privacy-focused system using overhead depth sensors near dispensers to detect hand presence/use.

- Media/architecture: depth frames with a lightweight CNN (single-stream per-frame classifier).
- Contribution: demonstrates accurate dispenser-use detection while preserving privacy via depth-only capture.
- Availability: data not public; code and trained weights not provided; no external API.
