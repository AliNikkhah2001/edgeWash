# Method Roadmap (seed ideas)

- Contrastive pretraining on synthetic + real handwashing clips to improve low-data regimes.
- Multi-view fusion: combine egocentric and fixed-camera streams with cross-attention.
- Continual learning to adapt to new sinks/lighting without catastrophic forgetting.
- On-device feedback loop: lightweight models that trigger verbal/visual cues during non-compliance.
