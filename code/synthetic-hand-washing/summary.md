# Synthetic Hand-Washing Data Generation

Rendering and augmentation toolkit for creating synthetic handwashing datasets plus training recipes for baseline models.

- Media: synthetic RGB, depth, masks, and point clouds.
- Architecture: InceptionV3 image classifier, YOLOv8 (classification/segmentation), and PointNet for point clouds.
- Contribution: Blender-based data generation plus baseline training recipes for synthetic-to-real transfer.
- Availability: code open; synthetic dataset public via Google Drive; pretrained models provided; no external API.
