# Code Collections

This folder aggregates handwashing-related codebases. Each subfolder mirrors an upstream repository and keeps its own README and scripts.

- `edgewash`: Original WHO hand-washing movement classification pipelines (moved from repo root).
- `huiwen-HandWash`: Multimodal surgical hand-rub recognition experiments.
- `hand-wash-compliance-yolo`: YOLO-based compliance detector for sink/soap usage.
- `synthetic-hand-washing`: Synthetic data generator for hand-washing actions.

See `catalog.json` for quick metadata and upstream sources.
